*Note:* This is an experimental branch adding a test library. A
couple funny little notes about this:

1. It depends on [[https://github.com/rejeep/ert-runner.el/pull/19][my changes to ert-runner]] because I want to mirror my
   source tree in the test directory, and stock ert-runner doesn't do
   that.  I'm hoping that can change.

2. To run the tests, first install the dependencies by running =cask=,
   and then you should be able to run =make unit=.  Note that if no
   tests run, you're probably using a stock version of ert-runner (see
   #1).
