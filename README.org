/Happy hacking!/

** Benchmarking

   Load time is reported at startup.  To delve into possible sources
   of slowness, use the following commands:

   - ~benchmark-init/show-durations-tabulated~
   - ~benchmark-init/show-durations-tree~

** Keybindings

   To discover keybindings, check ~core/keys.el~ and run =M-x
   describe-personal-keybindings RET=.

   (I'm in a bit of a transitional phase where things are bound via
   different mechanisms.)

** Tests

   To run the tests, run =make test=.
