Hi!

[MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org/) is the new younger sibling of MELPA for users who'd rather run only stable versions of packages (MELPA can be a bit rocky since every commit comprises a new release), and it would be super cool if ${1:this package} could be installed via Stable.

Fortunately it's also really easy to supportâ€”all you have to do is define a tag in the \`v...\` format and you're done. I'd submit a PR if I could, but since tags are global to a project, that's not something possible via PR.

If you're cool with this idea, this should be all you have to do to make it happen:

\`\`\`sh
$ git tag v${2:stable-version-number} ${3:stable-version-commit-hash}
$ git push origin v$2
\`\`\`

(Of course, confirm that $3 is the appropriate commit for the release, but it's the one where the version number was bumped to $2 so I suspect it is.)

Thanks for your time and consideration!
